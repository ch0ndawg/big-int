Project Big Int (Numerical Recipes)
**************************************************************************************************
Summary: a big integer class supporting all the usual arithmetic operations and more, as detailed in Numerical Recipes. Why? for the hell of it, and solving a few long-standing childhood questions. I'm quite sure that big ints have been beaten to death and there's loads of available implmentations. But nevertheless this is an interesting model project to exercise the software-design and coding-practices muscles, and also a new testing ground for programming techniques. Grinding the programming axe, so to speak. Plus, dare I say it, it can be great fun!
